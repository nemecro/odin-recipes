    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
      <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4
        to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and
        repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until it's 2 minutes away from
        being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over
        medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally,
        until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5
        minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but
        don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a
        spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir
        until butter melts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir
        until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
        Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
